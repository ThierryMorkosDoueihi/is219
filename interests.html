			<h3>Since I was a kid, I had an interest in music. When I was about 8 years old,
			my parents took me to my first piano lesson. Even though I stopped going after a 
			couple of times, I kept practicing by myself and started playing by ear. Later on 
			I started taking guitar lessons. Three years into that, my friend introduced 
			me to EDM and this is what really caught my attention. A little bit of research, 
			a lot of time listening to music and watching professional DJ performing in live shows 
			was all it took before I realized that I wanted to be a DJ. Started by using the
			virtual DJ free software and after some improvments, I finally bought my own professional 
			set: the Numark NDX400. A lot of practice made become a better DJ and then I took my first 
			step into the industry.

			<h3>I have always enjoyed all types of sports, but soccer was my favourite. I started playing 
			that game since I was very young. It all started when my neighbor and I bought our first ball 
			and started playing on the street next to the building we lived in. Then I decided to take the
			next step by joining an academy. At that time, I was already in a basketball academy, but I 
			have decided to quit since it was clear to me that I enjoy soccer a lot more. From that moment 
			it became my obsession. The only places to find me if I am not at practice nor school, would 
			be on the street playing more soccer, or in my bedroom watching soccer videos. Soon I started 
			improving a lot and at that time, I was seen as the team's leader especially when we started 
			competing in tournaments. As the years went by, I kept improving until I became the team's 
			captain and I got drafted to the National Soccer Team, at the age of 14. Unfortunately, about 
			a year and half later I decided to give up on my dream of becoming a professional player and 
			focus on my education. I stepped back a little bit and gave it less time but I kept playing 
			frequently: at least 5 hours a week.<br>When I got into college, I started practicing again with
			my old team, but I knew that it was going to be no more than a hobby of mine. A year later, I 
			transferred to William Paterson University and joined there men's soccer team for one year before
			transeferring again to NJIT.

			<h3>The first lesson I attended was when I was 10 years old and went with my friend to his lesson. 
			The artist who was teaching hime gave me a lot of attention and helped draw my first pastel drawing. 
			It was a pear leaning on a vase and it is still hung on the wall in my parents appartment. With a 
			little bit of his help, the outcome turned out to be really good and he suggested that I should start 
			taking lessons. Since that day, I started taking lessons weekly for over 6 years and due to my 
			improvements, I started drawing oil paintings too. Eventually, the lessons became more of a time for 
			me to draw peacfully in a quiet place, and all the teacher did was correct me sometimes and/or give
			me his personal opinion. Ultimetely, I stopped taking classes but I kept dawing in my free time.
			Till this day, my parent's appartment is still full of my paintings. You can find them on every wall 
			of every room.

			later, I picked up Muay Thai as my new martial art hobby but unfortunately, the class had a very small 
			amount of people registered in it and they had to cancel it.
